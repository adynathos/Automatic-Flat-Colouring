# Automatic-Flat-Colouring
LCAV - Audiovisual Communications Laboratory, Semester projects 2020, Fall semester

## Questions:

1. How can we achieve flat coloring using the dataset which is not flat coloring?

2. Do we need more dataset since there are only 772 images in DCM. (Also, the zip downloaded is corrupted.)
